The IBM Watsonâ„¢ Tone Analyzer Service uses linguistic analysis to detect three types of tones from written text: emotions, social tendencies, and language style. Emotions identified include things like anger, cheerfulness and sadness. Identified social tendencies include things from the Big Five personality traits used by some psychologists. These include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Identified language styles include things like confident, analytical, and tentative. Input email and other written media into the Tone Analyzer service, and use the results to determine if your writing comes across with the tone, personality traits, and writing style that you want for your intended audience.

This parameter defaults to `true` when it's not set, which means that a sentence level analysis is automatically provided. Change `sentences` to `false` to filter out the sentence level analysis.
