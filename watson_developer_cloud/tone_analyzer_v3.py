### Service Overview
The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer service uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional and
language tones in written text. The service can analyze tone at both the document and
sentence levels. You can use the service to understand how your written communications are
perceived and then to improve the tone of your communications. Businesses can use the
service to learn the tone of their customers' communications and to respond to each
customer appropriately, or to understand and improve their customer conversations.
### API Usage
The following information provides details about using the service to analyze tone:
* **The tone method:** The service offers `GET` and `POST /v3/tone` methods that use the
general purpose endpoint to analyze the tone of input content. The methods accept content
in JSON, plain text, or HTML format.
* **The tone_chat method:** The service offers a `POST /v3/tone_chat` method that uses the
customer engagement endpoint to analyze the tone of customer service and customer support
conversations. The method accepts content in JSON format.
* **Authentication:** You authenticate to the service by using your service credentials.
You can use your credentials to authenticate via a proxy server that resides in Bluemix,
or you can use your credentials to obtain a token and contact the service directly. See
[Service credentials for Watson
services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-credentials.html)
and [Tokens for
authentication](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-tokens.html).
* **Request Logging:** By default, all Watson services log requests and their results.
Data is collected only to improve the Watson services. If you do not want to share your
data, set the header parameter `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` to `true` for each request.
Data is collected for any request that omits this header. See [Controlling request logging
for Watson
services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-logging.html).

For more information about the service, see [About Tone
Analyzer](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/tone-analyzer/index.html).

        Analyze general purpose tone.

        Uses the general purpose endpoint to analyze the tone of your input content. The
        service analyzes the content for emotional and language tones. The method always
        analyzes the tone of the full document; by default, it also analyzes the tone of
        each individual sentence of the content.   You can submit no more than 128 KB of
        total input content and no more than 1000 individual sentences in JSON, plain
        text, or HTML format. The service analyzes the first 1000 sentences for
        document-level analysis and only the first 100 sentences for sentence-level
        analysis.   Use the `POST` request method to analyze larger amounts of content in
        any of the available formats. Use the `GET` request method to analyze smaller
        quantities of plain text content.   Per the JSON specification, the default
        character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8; per the HTTP
        specification, the default encoding for plain text and HTML is ISO-8859-1
        (effectively, the ASCII character set). When specifying a content type of plain
        text or HTML, include the `charset` parameter to indicate the character encoding
        of the input text; for example: `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8`. For
        `text/html`, the service removes HTML tags and analyzes only the textual content.
         **Note:** The `tones` query parameter is no longer supported. The service
        continues to accept the parameter for backward-compatibility, but the parameter no
        longer affects the response.

        :param ToneInput tone_input: JSON, plain text, or HTML input that contains the content to be analyzed. For JSON input, provide an object of type `ToneInput`.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: application/json, text/plain, or text/html. A character encoding can be specified by including a `charset` parameter. For example, 'text/plain;charset=utf-8'.
        :param bool sentences: Indicates whether the service is to return an analysis of each individual sentence in addition to its analysis of the full document. If `true` (the default), the service returns results for each sentence.
        :param str content_language: The language of the input text for the request: English or French. Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. The input content must match the specified language. Do not submit content that contains both languages. You can specify any combination of languages for `content_language` and `Accept-Language`.
        :param str accept_language: The desired language of the response. For two-character arguments, regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. You can specify any combination of languages for `Content-Language` and `accept_language`.
