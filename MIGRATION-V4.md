Here are simple steps to move from `v3.0.0` to `v4.0.0`. Note that `v4.0,0` supports only python `3.5` and above

## AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM
The constructor no longer accepts individual credentials like `iam_apikey`, etc. We initialize authenticators from the [core](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core). The core supports various authentication mechanisms, choose the one appropriate to your instance and use case.

For example, to pass a IAM apikey:
#### Before
```python
from ibm_watson import MyService

service = MyService(
    iam_apikey='{apikey}',
    url='{url}'
)
```

#### After(V4.0)
```python
from ibm_watson import MyService
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator

authenticator = IAMAuthenticator('{apikey}')
service = MyService(
    authenticator=authenticator
)
service.set_service_url('{url}')
```

There are 5 authentication variants supplied in the SDK (shown below), and it's possible now to create your own authentication implementation if you need something specific by implementing the Authenticator implementation.

#### BasicAuthenticator
```python
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import BasicAuthenticator

authenticator = BasicAuthenticator(<your_username>, <your_password>)
service = MyService(authenticator=authenticator)
```

#### BearerTokenAuthenticator
```python
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import BearerTokenAuthenticator

authenticator = BearerTokenAuthenticator(<your_bearer_token>)
service = MyService(authenticator=authenticator)

# can set bearer token
service.get_authenticator().set_bearer_token('xxx');
```

#### CloudPakForDataAuthenticator
```python
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import CloudPakForDataAuthenticator

authenticator = CloudPakForDataAuthenticator(
                 'my_username',
                 'my_password',
                 'https://my-cp4d-url',
                 disable_ssl_verification=True)
service = MyService(authenticator=authenticator)
```

#### IAMAuthenticator
```python
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator

authenticator = IAMAuthenticator('my_apikey')
service = MyService(authenticator=authenticator)
```

#### NoAuthAuthenticator
```python
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import NoAuthAuthenticator

authenticator = NoAuthAuthenticator()
service = MyService(authenticator=authenticator)
```

#### Creating an Authenticator from Environmental Configuration
```python
from ibm_cloud_sdk_core import get_authenticator_from_environment

authenticator = get_authenticator_from_environment('Assistant')
service = MyService(authenticator=authenticator)
```

## SETTING THE SERVICE URL
We can set the service url using `set_service_url()` or from external configurations.

#### Before
```python
service = MyService(
    iam_apikey='{apikey}',
    url='{url}' # <= here
)
```

#### After(V4.0)
```python
service = MyService(
    authenticator=authenticator,
)
service.set_service_url('{url}')
```

OR, pass from external configurations like environment variable
```bash
export MY_SERVICE_URL="<your url>"
```

## METHOD OPTIONAL PARAM
The method params which are optional would need to be specified by name rather than position. For example

#### Before
The list_workspaces with page_limit as 10 was:

```python
assistant_service.list_workspaces(10)
```

#### After(V4.0)
We need to specify the optional param name:

```python
assistant_service.list_workspaces(page_limit=10)
```

## DISABLING SSL VERIFICATION
#### Before
```python
service.disable_ssl_verification(True)
```

#### After(v4.0)
```python
service.set_disable_ssl_verification(True)
```

## SUPPORT FOR CONSTANTS
Constants for methods and models are shown in the form of Enums

## SUPPORT FOR PYTHON 2.7 and 3.4 AND BELOW DROPPED
The SDK no longer supports Pyhton versions 2.7 and <=3.4.
